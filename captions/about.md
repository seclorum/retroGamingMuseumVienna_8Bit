# About the 8-bit Computing Exhibit

Here we present a selection of working systems from the 'golden age' of 8-Bit Computing for your entertainment.

The 1980's were a fantastic time for computing, with a wide variety of designs competing for the affordable home computing market, producing lots of quirky systems that very quickly faded away into history as technology inevitably proceeded to make last years models irrelevant.

Nevertheless, each system of its type gathered and maintained a community of devotees - programmers and users and fans alike - who have kept the machines relevant and entertaining, even in the 21st Century.  

40 years later, new titles are still being released for many of these wonderful machines, which have proven to be resilient in spite of the constant march of technology towards newer, bigger, faster things.

We have focused our exhibit on a selection of machines you may not have ever known about - many of us recall having a Commodore C64 in our attic somewhere, but when did you ever hear of the Oric Atmos, or Amstrad CPC6128?

Our working machines have been upgraded with modern, 21st Century storage and peripheral systems, which make the systems even more fun to operate.  (No more waiting hours for cassette tapes to load!)

As fans of the 8-Bit Computing Era, we are also very keen to let you know about the annual 10-Line BASIC Coding Competition, which has the purpose of giving programmers around the world the opportunity to demonstrate just how much power these simple, 'primitive' machines really have.  

We hope you will be pleasantly surprised to see what can be done in 10 lines of BASIC code - modern programmers would find it very, very difficult to accomplish the same sort of results in 10 lines of code! The 10-line BASIC Competition certainly provides a glimpse of the liabilities of consumerism in the modern age. 

Have we lost something in the neverending onslaught of 'newer, faster, bigger'?  We can't write this sort of software any more!
