# Oric Atmos

## Released: 1982
## Discontinued (UK): 1984
## Re-launched in France: 1984 - discontinued, 1987

Here we present an Oric Atmos[1] for your entertainment, loaded with the winning entries of the annual *10-LINE BASIC PROGRAMMING COMPETITION*[2].

The Oric Atmos is an upgrade to the original Oric-1.  This is one of the lesser-known machines of the 8-Bit Computing Era.  

But yet, it persists as a retro- enthusiasts playground.

This computer was released originally to compete with the ZX Spectrum and Commodore C64 systems, originally in the UK - but eventually found more favourable conditions in the personal computing market in France, where its compatability with Minitel was considered beneficial, and in Eastern-bloc nations where clones (Pravetz 8D) were produced for the many fans of the 6502 CPU.

In spite of its weak performance on the market in the 80's, the Oric-1 and Atmos machines still have devoted fans in the contemporary retro-computing scene.  

This system has consistently been the winner of the *10-LINE BASIC PROGRAMMING COMPETITION* - demonstrating that, no matter how obscure the machine, someone will find a pleasing use for it...

Please see additional Operating Instructions for guidance on how to use this system.

# Operating Instructions

*The Oric Atmos can be turned off and on again - like all good computers should.*

You can use the _Power Switch_ for this, or you can disconnect and reconnect the "*barrel connector*" on the back of the machine.  

**If you need _help_, ask for the Attendant.**

Once you have reset the machine, you will be presented with the "**Ready**" prompt, indicating that the Oric Atmos is ready for commands - you could, for example, immediately start writing your own BASIC program.  

*To explore some of the games, type this command and then press RETURN:*

**CLOAD"**

(Don't forget the **"** symbol!)

Select a program from the list with the arrow keys and then press RETURN to load the game.  

Programs with names beginning with "**10**"  are entries from the *10-LINE BASIC PROGRAMMING COMPETITION*, which you can **CLOAD"**, **LIST** and **RUN** if you are *Ready*!  

*Feel free to make modifications to the BASIC listing if you feel inspired!*

There are also some other games in the list for you to explore which are not part of the *10-LINE BASIC PROGRAMMING COMPETITION* - and we will occasionally add some of the *new* games being written for the Oric, also .. 

Some interesting instructions you can give: **EXPLODE**, **CLOAD"**, **LIST**, **RUN**, **INK 5**, **PAPER 0**, **ZAP**, **INK 3**, **POP**, **CALL #C000**, **SHOOT**, **INK 2**, **PING**
