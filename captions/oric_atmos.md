# Oric Atmos

## Released: 1982
## Discontinued (UK): 1984
## Re-launched in France: 1984 - discontinued, 1987

The Oric Atmos [1], an upgrade to the original Oric-1, is one of the lesser-known examples of the machines of the 8-Bit Computing Era.  

This computer was released originally to compete with the ZX Spectrum and Commodore C64 systems, originally in the UK - but eventually found more favourable conditions in the personal computing market in France, where its compatability with Minitel was considered beneficial, and in Eastern-bloc nations where clones (Pravetz 8D) were produced for those behind the Iron curtain who nevertheless wanted a taste of Western computing.

In spite of its weak performance on the market in the 80's, the Oric-1 and Atmos machines still have devoted fans in the contemporary retro-computing scene.  

As a result of the love and dedication that its fans manifest, this system has been the winner of the 10-Line BASIC Programming Competition [2] for the past few years in a row - and as a personal favourite of the curator of the 8-bit exhibit, it is certain to put up a continued effort in the competition in the years to come.

Here we present an Oric Atmos for your entertainment, loaded with the winning entries of the 10-Line BASIC Programming Competition.  

Please see additional Operating Instructions for guidance on how to use this system.

# Operating Instructions

The Oric Atmos can be turned off and on again without harm or worry.  You can use the powerswitch for this, or you can disconnect and reconnect the "barrel connector" on the back of the machine.

Once you have reset the machine, you will be presented with the "Ready" prompt, indicating that the Oric Atmos is ready for commands - you could, for example, immediately start writing BASIC instructions.

To load some of the different entries of the 10-LINE BASIC Competition, you may issue the following command after a reset, to load a menu of the entries:

    CLOAD"

 .. at which point the menu will load with a number of entries from the 10-LINE BASIC Competition:

 PACMAN10 - A simple Pacman-like game.  Use the arrow keys to move around, eat the dots, and avoid the ghost!

 LANDER - A moon-landing simulation - use the LEFT and RIGHT Arrow keys to thrust in those directions, and the UP Arrow key to apply thrust to your lander.  Find a flat space to land!

 SNAKE - A Dungeon Crawling game - avoid the snakes, and collect the potions.  There are thousands of levels - collect all potions, with remaining HEALTH, to proceed through the level.

 THRUST10 - Use the LEFT and RIGHT Arrow keys to thrust your way up the screen to the top.


There are also some other games available, not part of the 10-LINE BASIC Competition:

KONG - A simple "Donkey Kong clone"

4KKONG - A version of the popular Game & Watch game "KONG"

After loading one of the 10-LINE BASIC Competition entries, you can view the code with the LIST command - and run it with the RUN command.  Feel free to make modifications to the BASIC listing if you feel inspired!
